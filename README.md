# Audio2D
This script provides the ability to dynamically control the volume of sound objects in a two-dimensional space. It can be used to optimize sound effects in a game, ensuring smooth volume changes based on the distance from the listener.

Key Elements:

* assignAudioListener: Determines whether the global listener is assigned or if the script works with individual sound sources.
* attemptedVolumeInStart: The volume value at the beginning of script execution.
* ChangeAudioVolume(): A function that calculates and applies volume changes based on the distance from the listener.
* This script offers flexibility in managing sound effects, optimizing resource usage, and creating an enhanced audio experience in the game.
